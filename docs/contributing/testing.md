# Testing

Use the following command to test all packages in watch mode. Refer to the [Jest CLI options][jest options] for details.

[jest options]: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#options

```sh
yarn test:watch
```

In general, this is sufficient during development. CircleCI and Travis will eventually apply a more rigorous set of
tests against your pull request, including the ones below.

If you want to add integration tests for compatibility with another library, please add an example for it.

## Testing for compatibility

```sh
yarn test:compat
```

This runs all tests using various versions of `react` and `react-dom`, to check for compatibility with older/newer
versions of React. This is what CircleCI and Travis run.

## Linting

Use `yarn lint` to verify your code style before committing. It's highly recommended to install the Prettier and ESLint plugins for your IDE. CircleCI and Travis will fail your build on lint errors.
